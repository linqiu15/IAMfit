# Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM)

Inverse amplitude method for unitarizing SU(3) chiral perturbation theory, following the paper:

A. Gomez Nicola, J. R. Pelaez, _Meson-meson scattering within one-loop chiral perturbation theory and its unitarization_, [Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 054009](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.054009) [[arXiv:hep-ph/0109056](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0109056)].

Fit to meson-meson scattering data using coupled-channel IAM with unitarity fulfilled by removing the imaginary part of the loops with unphysical left-hand cuts. The results are reported in

Y.-J. Shi, C.-Y. Seng, F.-K. Guo, B. Kubis, U.-G. Mei√üner, W. Wang, _Two-Meson Form Factors in Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory_, [arXiv:2011.00921](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00921).
